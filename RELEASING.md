Since Anki doesn't have any way to deploy plugins through CD,
    I'm inclined to put off developing a real pipeline
    for the parts I can automate,
    so in the meantime,
    here's at least a consistent set of manual release steps.


## Changing the docs

Aside from straight bugfix releases,
    the docs should be updated with every release.
In order to perform edits,
    first, edit the `docs/tiddlywiki.info` as follows:

```json
    "plugins": [
        "tiddlywiki/filesystem",
        "tiddlywiki/tiddlyweb"
    ],
```

Then cd into the `docs/` directory
and run `tiddlywiki --listen`.
You can now edit freely in your browser.
Roll back the `tiddlywiki.info` changes,
    commit the rest of your changes,
    and you're set.

*Suggestion for improvement*:
    Provide a way to use a different `tiddlywiki.info`,
    or to automatically remove those plugins on a production build,
    to avoid having to manually change it all the time.


## Bumping the version

1. Update the version number in `tw-plugin/plugin.info`.
   Also update it in the `TiddlyWiki Metadata` tiddler.
2. Open and save the `TiddlyRemember` main tiddler
   so that its modification date gets bumped.
3. Quit the TiddlyWiki listener and commit the changes to your release branch.


## Updating the Anki add-on

1. Update the add-on description in `ankiweb-description.html`,
   including a brief changelog message.
   Don't forget to bump the version number presented.
   Remember that the AnkiWeb description page has *significant whitespace*,
   terribly enough.
2. Run `make` in the root directory.
   This will update `anki-plugin/build.ankiaddon`.
3. Browse to the add-on's page:
   https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/60456529
4. Upload the `build.ankiaddon` file for the latest branch
   and copy and paste the new `ankiweb-description.html` content.
5. Leave this screen open until the remaining steps are ready.


## Publishing to GitHub

1. Check your branch log and make any final rebases or adjustments.
2. Push the branch to GitHub.
3. Create a pull request to `master`.
   If all looks good, complete with a rebase-and-merge and delete the branch.


## Publishing the docs and TiddlyWiki plugin

1. Ensure you have a clean working tree.
2. Check out the `master` branch and pull to update from GitHub
   to your just-merged PR.
3. Run `scripts/update-ghpages.sh`
   and follow the directions to push if the update is successful.
4. Browse out to the docs and verify they're updated,
   including the plugin tiddler itself.
   See https://sobjornstad.github.io/TiddlyRemember.
   It can take a minute or two to update a GitHub Pages site;
   refreshing will pick up the changes when they show up.


## Final steps

1. Click the Submit button on AnkiWeb to update the plugin.
2. Create a new release on GitHub to publicize the update:
   https://github.com/sobjornstad/TiddlyRemember/releases/new.
   The tag should be in the form `v0.0.0`, using standard semantic versioning.
