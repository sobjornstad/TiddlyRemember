title: Calling TiddlyWiki in MacOS
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

If you install TiddlyWiki via Homebrew on a Mac,
Homebrew does some path magic which makes the `tiddlywiki` and `node` commands
available at your command line,
but unfortunately does not make them available to Anki.
There are two options for working around this.

!! Option 1: Modify your path

Run the following command at a command line:

```
sudo launchctl config user path "/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

This will add the directory TiddlyWiki and Node are installed in to your system path.
See the [[Homebrew documentation|https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#my-mac-apps-dont-find-usrlocalbin-utilities]] for details.

After making this change, you'll need to restart your computer.
Then you'll be able to put `tiddlywiki` in the //Path to TiddlyWiki executable// [[configuration field|Configuring the Anki add-on]] and have it work.


!! Option 2: Launch TiddlyWiki from a shell script (advanced)

If you don't want to modify your system path or you don't have administrator privileges,
you can write a shell script that contains the full paths to Node and TiddlyWiki:

# Open a command line, enter the following commands, and note the results:
#* `which node`
#* `which tiddlywiki`
# Create a new text file in your favorite text editor, called `tiddlywiki`. You can place the file anywhere you like.
# Enter the following two lines:
#* `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
#* `node tiddlywiki "$@"` -- replacing //node// and //tiddlywiki// with the output of the commands in step 1.
# Save the file and make the script executable using `chmod +x` on the command line.
# Return to [[Configuring the Anki add-on]] and provide your shiny new shell script as the path to TiddlyWiki. It should test successfully now.
