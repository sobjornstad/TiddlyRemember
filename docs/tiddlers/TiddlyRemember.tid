TiddlyRemember is a tool that integrates the [[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]] non-linear note-taking system with the spaced-repetition-flashcards tool [[Anki|https://apps.ankiweb.net]].
You can interleave questions with your notes in TiddlyWiki,
    then sync them into Anki notes with one click.
You can edit and move the questions around your TiddlyWiki,
    and they will stay connected to the Anki notes.
Scheduling information in Anki is preserved when editing notes in TiddlyWiki.

Why would you want to keep your Anki notes in TiddlyWiki?

* One of the problems with using spaced repetition to study complex topics is that individual cards can end up largely without context, and if you need a refresher, it's hard to find the original source. TiddlyRemember can take you right back to your notes.
* If you already have notes on a topic, this can help keep your content more [[DRY|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself]] -- you don't have to maintain the same knowledge in two places. If your knowledge on a topic changes and you update your notes or flashcards, they won't get out of sync.
* You can easily add notes to your Anki collection at the same time you're taking narrative or outline notes, without having to switch back and forth between two applications.
