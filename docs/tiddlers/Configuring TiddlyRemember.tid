type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

TiddlyRemember configuration is found in several places,
    in both your wiki(s) and in Anki.

* [[Add-on configuration|Configuring the Anki add-on]] within Anki is used to list the wikis you want to sync to your Anki collection. ''You have to set up the add-on configuration before you can sync anything'', so you should do this immediately after installing TiddlyRemember.

Other things you can, but do not have to, configure:

* [[Mapping tiddlers]] within your wiki(s) are used to determine what decks and tags your notes will have in Anki. You can also [[override decks and tags per note|Overriding decks and tags]].
* [[Card templates|Editing card templates]] within Anki can be edited to further customize the display of your cards.
* [[TiddlyRemember snippets]] within your wiki(s) can be edited to influence the question template that appears when you select one of the TiddlyRemember icons on the editor toolbar.
