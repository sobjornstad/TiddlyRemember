TiddlyRemember configuration is found in two places, in your wiki(s) and in Anki.

* [[Mapping tiddlers]] within your wiki(s) are used to determine what decks and tags your notes will have in Anki. Mapping tiddlers are entirely optional â€“ if you don't need different decks and tags in Anki, just ignore them.
*  [[Add-on configuration|Configuring the Anki add-on]] within Anki is used to list the wikis you want to sync to your Anki collection. You have to set up the add-on configuration before you can sync anything.
* [[Editing card templates]] in Anki is an advanced feature that allows you to further customize the display of your cards.
