Question-and-answer notes are created with the `rememberq` TiddlyWiki macro, like this:

```
<<rememberq "20200523163414806"
    "How do you create a question-and-answer pair in TiddlyRemember?"
    "With the `rememberq` macro, inserted by clicking the white lightbulb icon on the edit toolbar."
>>
```

That renders like this in TiddlyWiki:

<<rememberq "20200523163414806"
    "How do you create a question-and-answer pair in TiddlyRemember?"
    "With the `rememberq` macro, inserted by clicking the white lightbulb icon on the edit toolbar."
>>

And when reviewing in Anki:

Clicking the white (left-hand) lightbulb icon on the edit toolbar
    will insert a `rememberq` snippet.

[[Pair notes]] are like question-and-answer notes, but also create a card showing the “answer” on the front and the “question” on the back.
