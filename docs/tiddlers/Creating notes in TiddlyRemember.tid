title: Creating notes in TiddlyRemember
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Snippets that you want to remember using TiddlyRemember are called //notes// (as in Anki).
You describe the snippets using TiddlyWiki macros.

TiddlyRemember supports several types of notes:

<ul>
  <$list filter="[tag<currentTiddler>]">
    <li><$link to=<<currentTiddler>>><<currentTiddler>></$link>, with the <code>{{!!macro}}</code> macro</li>
  </$list>
</ul>

The first parameter to both the `rememberq` and `remembercz` macros
is the note's [[Unique ID]].
As long as you never change the unique ID,
you can edit your question and answer text
and move the question between tiddlers and even between wikis,
and your scheduling information in Anki will be preserved.
It's important that you do not reuse unique IDs (thus making them non-unique),
as this will cause TiddlyRemember to randomly overwrite one question with another.
To aid in creating unique IDs, when you use either of the TiddlyRemember editor toolbar buttons
(the white and black lightbulbs),
a unique ID consisting of the current millisecond timestamp will be inserted automatically.

After you add, edit, or remove questions in TiddlyWiki, you'll want to [[sync to Anki|Syncing TiddlyRemember with Anki]].

The parser actually renders the tiddlers when you sync to Anki,
    so you can include transclusions within the macro parameters if needed,
    and the referents will display both in your wiki and on your Anki cards.
However, HTML will be stripped when creating Anki notes,
    so links, text formatting, etc., will only show up in your wiki;
    this may change in the future.

If you need to include quotes in a note, use triple quotes for the macro parameter:

```
<<rememberq "20200523163414807"
    """How do you include "quotation marks" within a macro parameter in TiddlyWiki?"""
    "Use triple quotation marks on the outside."
>>
```

<<rememberq "20200523163414807"
    """How do you include "quotation marks" within a macro parameter in TiddlyWiki?"""
    "Use triple quotation marks on the outside."
>>


!! Advanced features

* If you plan to transclude any tiddlers containing questions into other tiddlers, you'll want to read about [[Soft and hard references]].
* In many cases, you can [[dynamically create questions|Dynamically generating TiddlyRemember notes]] from data stored elsewhere in your wiki using filters.
