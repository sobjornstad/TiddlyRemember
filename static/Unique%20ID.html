<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>TiddlyRemember relies on a <strong>unique ID</strong> field to sync notes to Anki.
This is the first parameter to the <code>rememberq</code> and <code>remembercz</code> macros
on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Question-and-answer%2520notes.html">Question-and-answer notes</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Cloze%2520notes.html">Cloze notes</a> respectively,
and the field called <code>ID</code> on your notes in Anki.
The use of a unique ID means you can edit notes and move them around between tiddlers and wikis and TiddlyRemember can still tell which Anki note they're connected to.</p><p>Unique IDs are generated automatically with the current millisecond timestamp when you click either of the lightbulb buttons on the edit toolbar to create a TiddlyRemember snippet.</p><p>Once a unique ID has been created, you ordinarily should not edit it. Typically, changing the unique ID, either in Anki or in TiddlyWiki, will result in the note being deleted from Anki and recreated without its review history. If you change a note so much that it should be rescheduled from scratch, you may choose to do this intentionally.</p><p>Unique IDs, as the name suggests, need to be <em>unique</em>. If there is a collision (more than one note has the same ID), only one note will be created in Anki, and which values it has will be random on every sync. This is obviously bad, so it's best to use the snippet buttons every time you create a note to be sure you don't accidentally create a collision.</p><p>If you transclude a tiddler that contains TiddlyRemember notes, this will create a kind of “collision” in that two different tiddlers contain a question with the same ID when rendered. Generally, nothing bad will happen here since the contents will be the same. However, if you're doing this, you will want to use <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Soft%2520and%2520hard%2520references.html">hard references</a> to manually specify the source of the questions that are being transcluded – otherwise, which tiddler is cited as the source may change randomly from one sync to the next, producing spurious updates and making it hard to identify the source you intended to cite.</p><h2 class="">Prefixing IDs</h2><p>If you're creating TiddlyRemember notes in a wiki that will be distributed to others,
    you may wish to prefix your unique IDs with an identifier.
Although collisions between millisecond timestamps are unlikely,
    the more widely your questions get distributed,
    the more likely that someone else happens to create a note at the same time.
If you're concerned about such collisions,
    override the shadow tiddler <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-shadow" href="%2524%253A%252Fconfig%252FTiddlyRemember%252FIdPrefix.html">$:/config/TiddlyRemember/IdPrefix</a>
    to include an appropriate prefix.
For instance, in this wiki, I might use <code>trdoc-</code>,
    and subsequently generated IDs would look like <code>trdoc-20200926182550795</code>.</p><p>This option is not retroactive –
    questions you have already created
    will continue to have whatever IDs they had when you created them,
    unless you go and manually change them in your wikitext.</p></div>
